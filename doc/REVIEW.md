1. Code is structured very well throughout all the activities, very good flow in layout.
2. There are no headers present in the code.
3. Very concise use of comments. Short, but effective. However, there are some activities like myAdapter.java without any comments at all.
4. Formating of the code throughout the code is done very well, good spacing, indentation and line breaks.
5. Good decomposition, each method only does a very limited amount of tasks.
6. There is still a file in the Main folder that is not used at all and doesnt contain any code (Gson.java) and should be removed.
7. Names of variables and methods is concise and clear. By only reading these, one understands what the variable contains of method does.
8. Modularization is well done. Minimal communication between modules and only contain the necessary variables.
9. Good re-use of library functionality and use of idiom throughout the code.
10. Although most methods have excellent comments, I often miss some explanation in the onCreate parts of your code that explains to me
what is happening when the activity is created.
